# GVLogis

In this case, it's a desktop application capable of proficiently managing the business, logistics, and maintenance operations of a goods transportation company. This development brings back very good memories. 

The stack consists of Visual Basic, the .NET environment, and Microsoft SQL Server.

Object-oriented programming was meticulously applied, focusing on comprehensive case handling and error management, complemented by a design that reflects the era.

 I hope this work can serve as a valuable reference for my coding approach as well as for the contributions of my colleague, Juan Carlos Ramirez, with whom I developed this application. 
 
 The project showcases object-oriented programming and a relational database architecture, offering flexibility for both businesses and their employees.
